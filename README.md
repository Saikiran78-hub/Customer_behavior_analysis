# Customer_behavior_analysis
 Data analysis project customer behavior analysis using python, sql and power BI
📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to extract insights from raw data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation, followed by professional reporting and presentation.


🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

BI Tool: Power BI

Database: Relational Databases

Presentation: Gamma (PPT)

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🔍 Project Workflow & Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Checked structure, data types, and shape

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and distributions

Trend analysis and correlation checks

Outlier detection and missing value analysis

Visualizations using charts and plots

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates
